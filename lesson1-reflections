Q. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A. 'diff' shows changed lines between two files,
- : removed lines
+ : added lines
the old and new lines appear next to each other easing the comparison by eye.


Q. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A. Reminding you of useful pieces of code and methods that you may have forgotten and would like or need to use again.

Q. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

A. A manual choice tends to be done at logical boundaries, automatic at arbitrary change points.


Q. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A. With GIT it is likely the files are interrelated, a change in one relates to changes in others. Google docs is a general purpose system for non-specialist users.


Q. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A. git log --stat -i --grep=revert
is an easy way otherwise use 
'git log'
to look at the commit logs and get their id's then use 
'git diff firstID secondID'
to display their differences.

Q. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A. Using a combination of 'git log' and 'git checkout idnumber' one can revert to a previous version of code files if recent changes are not desired.

Q. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A. I would like to begin using it for the rare occasions when I develop program code, soon that may be for the PyBoard. Also I suspect it may have other good uses, perhaps when writing documentation etc.
